# hello-world
A repository for my personal projects (maybe useful for work, leisure or anything really)

Something about me:
- A mostly self-taught programmer with an accounting background trying to make a difference in the business world by making things more efficient. 
- Interested in Fintech and automation.
- I code in Python and VBA. Some SQL, some Java, a little bit of R.
- I have an Intagram account for my watercolor art: https://www.instagram.com/hw_amazingart. 
- I'm in the progress of learning many different things: Korean language, CFA, guitar, and fitness.
- I created this account so I can keep all my code here. I've got a few recent projects that I want to showcase and revisit in the future.
