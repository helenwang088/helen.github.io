## Check out my TOP 3 not so serious personal projects
I wrote all of these during the magical year of 2020. I hope you will love them too.


### [Auto clicker](https://github.com/helenwang088/projects/blob/gh-pages/Active.py)

This is a tool that helps you to move around your cursor for as long as you like. Definitely NOT designed to use at work.


### [Instagram unfollower](https://github.com/helenwang088/projects/blob/gh-pages/IG%20unfollower/instagram.py)

Have you ever wondered why your IG followers dropped again? Who decided to unfollow you without you knowing? Yes, find out who they are and you should probably unfollow them too.


### Book your favorite skating rink (Upcoming)

Designed to cope with the 8AM booking madness of reserving a leisure skate at a [City of Toronto skating rink](https://efun.toronto.ca/TorontoFun/Activities/ActivitiesAdvSearch.asp?SectionId=119&SubSectionId=179) during provincial lockdown. This program is going to help you select your fav rinks close to you and automatically book for you. 

A work in progress...

### Split-and-save

Dealing with a master spreadsheet? This macro helps you split up tabs and save them individually into a folder with tab names as file names. 


### IT tickets summary

This macro allows you to upload multiple IT help desk tickets in PDF and summarizes key information defined by you (e.g. requester, resolution time, etc) on a single Excel worksheet. You can take a quick glance and get the big picture in less than 1 minute. If you are an auditor, then this "bot" might have done your job for you.
